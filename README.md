# Poker

[My Notes](notes.md)

Poker is a family of card games, centered on betting, hand rankings, and a mix of skill, strategy, and chance. Players are dealt cards from a standard deck and place bets into a common pot based on how strong they believe their hand is (or how well they can bluff). Variants like Texas Holdâ€™em and Omaha are globally popular, with organized tournaments and cash games that reward both strategic play and psychological reading of opponents.

I am going to build a peer-to-peer multiplayer web application modeled after Poker, where players can connect, receive cards, place bets, and determine winners in real time.




## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Luck, strategy, and a little bit of nerve â€” thatâ€™s Poker. Build the best hand, place your bets, or bluff your way to victory. Compete with friends in real time and see who can climb the leaderboard. Every round brings new chances to win big and prove your skill at the table.

### Design

![Design image](pokerDraft1.jpeg)

The basic idea for the Poker application is a page to login, play, and view leaders in the application. 


### Key features

- Login, logout, and register
- See high scores (total earnings)
- Receive notifications for other player's achievements
- See a description of the app
- View a list of the best Poker players

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Four different views, login/register controls, play, scoreboard, and about.
- **CSS** - Complementary color scheme, responsive design, button highlighting during play.
- **React** - Single page application with routing between views, reactive user controls, and state hooks.
- **Service** - Endpoints for authentication, storing/retrieving scores. Third party call to get inspirational quotes.
- **DB/Login** - Stores authentication and scores.
- **WebSocket** - Broadcast user's game notifications.
