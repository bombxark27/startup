    <p>Poker is a family of card games, centered on betting, hand rankings, and a mix of skill, strategy, and chance.
        Players are dealt cards from a standard deck and place bets into a common pot based on how strong they believe
        their hand is (or how well they can bluff). Variants like Texas Holdâ€™em and Omaha are globally popular, with
        organized tournaments and cash games that reward both strategic play and psychological reading of opponents.</p>
